# 🎬 Silver Screen Cinema Profitability Analysis
## 📌 Project Overview

This dbt project was built to support business analysis for Silver Screen, a movie theater chain operating three locations in New Jersey (NJ_001, NJ_002, NJ_003), recently acquired by a major Entertainment Company,based on the logic that the rental cost is the price the distributor pays to the studio for the rights to screen a movie for a week or a month, as a fixed amount, independent of the number of screening locations. 

The main goal of the project is to analyze the relationship between monthly movie rental costs and revenue generated from ticket sales, evaluate location efficiency, and deliver a clean, reliable analytics mart for BI reporting and decision-making.

The project uses Snowflake as the data warehouse, dbt Cloud for transformations, testing, and orchestration, and Tableau for downstream analytics.

## 🧱 Tech Stack

Data Warehouse: Snowflake

Transformation & Testing: dbt Cloud

Version Control: Git / GitHub

BI Tool: Tableau

## 📂 Data Sources

All raw data is loaded into Snowflake and defined in dbt as sources:

movie_catalogue – movie metadata (title, genre, studio)

invoices – monthly rental costs per movie and location

nj_001 – transaction-level ticket sales

nj_002 – daily aggregated ticket sales

nj_003 – item-level purchases (tickets, snacks, drinks)

⚠️ Source data arrives in different formats and grains, requiring normalization, filtering, and aggregation.

## 🏗️ Project Architecture (DAG)

The project follows a layered dbt architecture:

Sources → Staging → Intermediate → Mart

### 1️⃣ Staging Layer (stg_)

Purpose:

Clean raw source data

Standardize column names and data types

Handle missing values

Apply basic filters and transformations

Key actions:

Replace missing genres with 'Unknown'

Filter nj_003 to product_type = 'ticket'

Extract month from timestamps

Normalize ticket and revenue fields across locations

### 2️⃣ Intermediate Layer (int_)

Purpose:

Align data grain

Unify data across locations

Resolve duplication and aggregation issues

Key models:

int_union_locations_revenue

Unifies ticket sales and revenue from all locations

Aggregated at monthly level

Grain: 1 row = movie + location + month

int_movie_costs

Aggregates invoice data

Handles multiple invoices per movie/location/month

Produces a single monthly rental cost per movie and location

### 3️⃣ Mart Layer (mart_)

Purpose:

Deliver business-ready analytics

Serve as a single source of truth for BI tools

Final Model: mart_cinema_profitability

Grain:
1 row = 1 movie + 1 location + 1 month

Columns:

movie_id

movie_title

genre

studio

month

location_id

rental_cost

tickets_sold

revenue

This table is used directly for:

Profitability analysis

Location efficiency comparison

Genre performance insights

Tableau dashboards

⚠️ Rental cost is fixed per movie per month, regardless of the number of locations.

## 🧪 Testing Strategy
Built-in dbt Tests

Defined in schema.yml files:

not_null

unique

Relationship tests where applicable

Custom (Singular) Tests

Custom SQL tests are stored in the /tests directory:

mart_duplicate_grain
Ensures no duplicate rows at the defined mart grain (movie + location + month)

missing_movies_in_mart
Validates that all rented movies appear in the final mart

negative_amounts
Ensures ticket sales and revenue are never negative

All tests are executed via:

dbt test

## 📘 Documentation

All models and key columns are documented in .yml files

Documentation is written for:

Business users

BI analysts

Future data engineers

dbt documentation is generated using:

dbt docs generate

## 🔄 CI / Automation

The project is deployed in dbt Cloud

A scheduled Cloud Job runs:

dbt build


CI ensures:

All models build successfully

All tests pass

No broken dependencies are deployed

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

Configure Snowflake connection in dbt Cloud

Install dependencies:

dbt deps


Run the full pipeline:

dbt build


Generate documentation:

dbt docs generate

## 📊 Downstream Usage

The final mart feeds Tableau dashboards covering:

Revenue vs Rental Cost over time

Monthly profit and loss

Revenue by location

Performance by movie and genre

📈 Key Insights (Summary)

Total rental costs exceed total revenue across most months

NJ_003 alone generates nearly as much revenue as NJ_001 and NJ_002 combined

Only May and October show slight profitability

Most profitable genres:

Action

Animation

Comedy

Sci-Fi

Higher revenue at NJ_003 is likely driven by a broader offering that attracts more visitors

## 🧠 Recommendations

Introduce drinks and snacks at NJ_001 and NJ_002 to attract more visitors and increase revenue

Consider acquiring one or two additional theaters

Leverage fixed rental costs by maximizing distribution reach

## ⚠️ Assumptions & Limitations

Monthly rental cost is assumed to be fixed per movie, independent of the number of locations

Analysis focuses on ticket revenue only (excluding snacks/drinks from revenue metrics)

Results depend on the accuracy and completeness of provided source data
