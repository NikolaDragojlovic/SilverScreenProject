# SilverScreenProject

## 📌 Project Purpose

This dbt project was built to support business analysis for Silver Screen, a movie theater chain in New Jersey recently acquired by a major Entertainment Company.

The main business goal is to analyze the relationship between monthly movie rental costs and revenue generated across three theater locations, and to provide a clean, reliable, and well-documented analytics mart for reporting and dashboarding.

My logic is that the rental cost is the price the distributor pays to the studio for the rights to screen a movie for a week or a month, as a fixed amount, independent of the number of screening locations.

Following this logic, Silverscreen as a distributor would be operating at a loss of 1.7 million USD on an annual basis.

If, on the other hand, the correct logic were that the rental cost is the price the distributor pays per screening location, then Silverscreen would be operating at a loss of more than 35 million USD annually,
which is approximately three times higher than total revenue.
If that were the case, they would not wait a full year to take action—they would realize within the first two months that something is fundamentally wrong.

## 🧱 Tech Stack

Database: Snowflake

Transformation Tool: dbt Cloud

Version Control: Git

Visualization: Tableau (downstream)

## 📂 Data Sources

Raw data is loaded into Snowflake and defined in dbt as sources:

movie_catalogue – movie metadata (title, genre, studio)

invoices – monthly rental costs per movie and location

nj_001 – transaction-level ticket sales

nj_002 – daily aggregated ticket sales

nj_003 – item-level purchases (tickets, snacks, drinks)

⚠️ Source data comes in different formats and grains, requiring careful normalization and aggregation.

## 🏗️ Project Architecture (DAG)

The project follows a layered dbt architecture:

### 1️⃣ Staging Layer (stg\_)

Purpose:

Clean raw source data

Standardize column names and data types

Handle missing values and basic filtering

Examples:

Replace missing genres with 'Unknown'

Filter nj_003 to include only product_type = 'ticket'

Extract month from timestamps

Normalize ticket and revenue fields across locations

### 2️⃣ Intermediate Layer (int\_)

Purpose:

Align data grain

Unify data across locations

Resolve duplication and aggregation issues

Key models:

int_union_locations_revenue

Unions cleaned data from all three locations

Aggregates monthly ticket sales and revenue

Grain: 1 row = movie + location + month

int_movie_costs

Aggregates invoice data

Handles multiple invoices per movie/location/month

Produces a single monthly rental cost per movie and location

### 3️⃣ Mart Layer (mart\_)

Purpose:

Deliver business-ready analytics tables

Serve as a single source of truth for BI tools

Final model:

mart_cinema_profitability

Grain:

1 row = movie + location + month

Columns:

movie_id

movie_title

genre

studio

month

location_id

rental_cost

tickets_sold

revenue

This table is used directly for:

Profitability analysis

Location efficiency comparison

Genre performance insights

Tableau dashboards

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

Built-in dbt tests

Implemented in schema.yml:

not_null

unique

Relationship tests where applicable

Custom (Singular) Tests

Custom SQL tests are stored in the /tests directory.

Examples:

mart_duplicate_grain
→ Ensures no duplicate rows at the defined grain (movie + location + month)

missing_movies_in_mart
→ Validates that all rented movies appear in the final mart

negative_amounts
→ Checks that ticket sales and revenue are never negative

All tests are executed via:

dbt test

## 📘 Documentation

All models and key columns are documented in .yml files

Descriptions are written to support:

Business users

BI analysts

Future data engineers

dbt documentation is generated using:

dbt docs generate

## 🤖 Automation & Deployment

The project is deployed using dbt Cloud

A scheduled Cloud Job runs:

dbt build

CI ensures:

All models build successfully

All tests pass

No broken dependencies are deployed

## 📊 Downstream Usage

The final mart is designed for:

Tableau dashboards

Monthly performance reviews

Strategic decisions regarding:

Pricing

Location expansion

Product offering (e.g. snacks & drinks)

## ✅ Project Status

Sources defined

Models built

Custom tests implemented

Documentation completed

Cloud Job configured and executed successfully
